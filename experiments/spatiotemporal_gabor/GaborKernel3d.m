function result = GaborKernel3d(v,theta,xi,opt,bandwidth)

%Input : v     = preferred speed of the filter (in pixels per frame)
%	 theta = preferred direction of motion, The convention is that 0 is rightward motion with 
%		pi/2 and pi radians denoting upward and leftward motion.
%	 xi    = phase of the filter (symmteric or anti-symmteric)
%  	 opt   = If 0 the spatial Gaussian Envelope is stationary else the spatial Gaussian Envelope moves with the
%		 same speed as the harmonic (cosine) factor
%        bandwidth = bandwidth of the filter
	 

%output result : A three dimensional matrix that defines a normalized 3D Spatiotemporal Gabor filter

%usage : result = GaborKernel3d(1,0,0,1,1);

%For causality we do the following

%The following part concerns normalization of the kernel. It is primarily done so that the filter does not respond for 
%constant input. The goal is make sure the integral of the kernel (sum of positive and negative values is zero)

% NORMALIZATION of positive and negative values to ensure that the integral of the kernel is 0.

ppos = find(result > 0); %pointer list to indices of elements of result which are positive
pneg = find(result < 0); %pointer list to indices of elements of result which are negative 

pos =     sum(result(ppos));  % sum of the positive elements of result
neg = abs(sum(result(pneg))); % abs value of sum of the negative elements of result
meansum = (pos+neg)/2;
if (meansum > 0) 
   pos = pos / meansum; % normalization coefficient for negative values of result
   neg = neg / meansum; % normalization coefficient for psoitive values of result
end

result(pneg) = pos*result(pneg);

%The kernel can be viewed with the help of functions such as imagesc in matlab. One can
%view only one frame at a time. If the kernel is of size m*m*m, because of causality the first m/2 - 1 frames are set to zero. 
%Therefore, meaningful viewing is possible only from m/2 th frame. Further, one has to find the maximum value 
%and the minimum value of the kernel (say, maxker and minker, respectively) and add them as options in imagesc function in %order to see the change of intensity of the excitatory and inhibitory lobes of the kernel over different frames. 
%For example if the kernel is of size 16 * 16 * 16, one could use imagesc(result(:,:,9),[minker,maxker]); to view 9th %frame.
